<h1 align="center"> üëã Hey, I'm Miloslav </h1>

I'm a Prague-based software developer who's into building web and mobile apps. I used to work in recruitment but I left my HR career to fully focus on switching to engineering. I succeeded and I'm currently gaining experience mainly in backend and Android development. Besides development itself I like to engage in various activities, especially in the community of beginning developers.
