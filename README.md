# 👋 Hey there, I'm Miloslav
- 💼 I'm a full-stack developer based in Prague, building web apps. Both clean UIs and how everything works behind the scene.
- 🌱 Getting better with the server-side logic and APIs, which is what I enjoy the most. Add a bit of DevOps magic later.
- ⚡ Very interested in projects and products solving real problems, or related to languages and history.
