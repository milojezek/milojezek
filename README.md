# 👋 Hello
My name is Miloslav but you can call me Milo or Milek. I'm a Prague-based software developer from Czechia.

- 👨‍💻 Working in FPT where contributing to both frontend and backend for building web and mobile apps

- 🌱 Currently, focusing on learning and using React and React Native because of projects I'm involved in

- 💭 Would like to learn about DevOps, cloud computing and related stuff in the near future

- ⚡ Super interested in foreign languages, I enjoy playing volleyball and travelling
  
- 🤝 Might be open to collaboration on small side-projects >>> [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/miloslav-jezek/) or milojezek4apps@gmail.com.

## 🛠️ Languages and tools
- ⚙️ The language of my choice would be **Kotlin** but **Java** is also ok when needed. I have basic knowledge of **Spring Boot** and **Ktor** and the databases I've had a chance to use are **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB**. In the past, I learned Python and C# a little bit but I've never used these languages beyond the scope of beginner courses.
  
- 🎨 When it comes to frontend stuff, I've used **HTML**, **CSS** and **Bootsrap** occasionally and currently, I'm learning **React** and **React Native**. Besides that, I have some experience creating UIs with **Jetpack Compose** for **Android** and using some other Jetpack libraries.
