# 👋 Hey there, I'm Miloslav
I'm a full‑stack developer based in Prague, building web apps—both clean UIs and everything that happens behind the scenes. I'm focusing on getting better with server‑side logic and APIs, which is what I enjoy the most. Later on, I want to add a bit of DevOps magic to my toolkit. The projects and products I find most interesting are the ones solving real problems, or anything connected to languages and history.
